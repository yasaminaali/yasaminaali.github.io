Research and Academic experience
======
* Explainable Detection of Online Sexism (EDOS)                                             
  * Research on SemEval 2023 dataset of Gab and Reddit. This research consists of three tasks of flagging what is                   sexist content and also explaining why it is sexist, experiencing state-of-the-art NLP models. 

* Data mining project with heart disease dataset from Kaggle using Python               
	* Used supervised and unsupervised algorithms (k-nearest neighbor, 
 	  naive bayes, logistic regression, decision tree, k-means, one-r)
